Description plan for the application:

First create a menu with Link items to Contact list and Create

The Contact list (which is a usestate) should show first and last name of the contact, and have a "View" link that opens the profile of the contact. 

The contact profile should show additional information about the contact. With a navigate button that returns the user to the contact list. 

In the Create part there should be a form where the user can input information about the user, and submit the form. The form creates a new user (which is a usestate) and then save it to the API. Then the created contact should be visible for the user in the contact list.
