Description plan for the application:

First create a menu with Link items to Contact list and Create

The Contact list (which is a usestate) should show first and last name of the contact, and have a "View" link that opens the profile of the contact.

The contact profile should show additional information about the contact. With a navigate button that returns the user to the contact list.

In the Create part there should be a form where the user can input information about the user, and submit the form. The form creates a new user (which is a usestate) and then save it to the API. Then the created contact should be visible for the user in the contact list.

(((ADDED)))
Contact profile has a link to update contact and delete contact.

In delete contact the id gets used to send a DELETE request to the api, which removes the object from the api database.

In update contact the user can write in the fields and submit the form. The fields gets set to a new useState "updateUser" which then overwrites the existing object in the api through a PUT request.

The profile has a map based on the coordinates in the object.
