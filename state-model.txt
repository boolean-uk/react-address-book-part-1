A list of contact objects. 
Dummy data is initially fetched from 'https://boolean-api-server.fly.dev/alexandra7667/contact' 
and the state variable is passed as props to
- <Dashboard/> to be passed to <ContactList/> where the list is rendered to the view
- <CreateContact/> so another contact object can be manually created and added to the list
- <ViewContact/> to find a certain contact in the list based on id

<CreateContact/>
[contactData, setContactData]
Data gathered from a form.
[savedAnswers, setSavedAnswers]
When the form is submitted, the collected data is saved to be sent to an API.
