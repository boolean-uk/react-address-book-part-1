# State Model

The states to keep track of in this project will be

- the contacts
- the selected contact

In the Create contact form component, in order to implement a controlled form, we keep track of the input object (the state) that is to become the new contact with following properties:

- the first name input
- the last name input
- the street input
- the city input

## Sample JSON object

```javascript
{
    "firstName": "Maha",
    "lastName": "Riazi",
    "street": "Somestreet 12",
    "city": "Oslo"
}
```
