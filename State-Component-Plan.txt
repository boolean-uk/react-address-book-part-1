STATE MODEL: 

const exampleContact = {
  id: 2,
  firstName: 'Jane',
  lastName: 'Smith',
  street: '456 Elm St',
  city: 'Sometown',
};

im assuming the ID gets assigned automatically, and the input fields require the names, street and city values.

Main endpoint for data: 

- https://boolean-api-server.fly.dev/

user can view a dashboard that displays a list of contacts
Each contact in the list should be displayed as their first and last names - GET


user can click a contact's name to view more details about that contact
The view should contain the contact's first and last name, as well as the contact's street and city


user can create a contact via a form, accessed by clicking a "Create a contact" menu link - POST


The form should create a contact with a first and last name, as well as a street and city
When submitted, the contact data should be sent to an API that saves it
The user should then be automatically navigated back to the contact list - useNavigate("/")

Allow for deleting a contact - DELETE

Allow for updating a contact's information - PUT

Automatically navigate to the contact list after deleting a contact - useNavigate("/")

Automatically navigate to the single contact information view after updating a contact - useNavigate()


COMPONENT TREE: 

App.jsx:	

Manages the overall state.
Renders the Dashboard component.

Dashboard.jsx:

Displays a list of contacts.
Maps through the contacts array and renders a ContactListItem for each contact.

ContactListItem.jsx:

Displays the first and last name of a contact.
Handles the click event to navigate to the ContactDetails component.

CreateContactForm.jsx:

Renders a form with fields for first name, last name, street, and city.
Submits the form data to an API to create a new contact.
Navigates the user back to the Dashboard after successful submission.

I also added two new files for editing and deleting contacts for the extension.


How it should look:

- App

    - ContactListItem

  - ContactDetails
  - CreateContactForm
  - DeleteContact (Extension)
  - EditContact (Extension)
